      <li style="color:white">A Nightmare On Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors</li>
      <li style="color:white">Halloween III (yes, I said it: Halloween III is my favorite of the whole franchise and that includes Rob Zombie's remakes, which aren't as bad as everyone says)</li>
      <li style="Color:white">Trick R' Treat</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2 style="color:white">Here are some random movie opinions (hot takes or not)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Nightmare on Elm Street reboot was not bad; I think it is good as a movie and fine as a reboot/remake</li>
      <li>The Friday the 13th remake was not bad either; I think that the kills were really fun and interesting</li>
      <li>Practical effects are always better than digital effects</li>
      <li>Malignant sucked</li>
      <li>All paranormal horror is garbage. Yes, that means The Conjuring</li>
      <li>The Forever Purge was awful. It was 2 hours of cowboys shooting at each other, with a really predictable plot</li>
      <li>You're Next is an amazing slasher film, having some of my favorite slasher killers</li>
      <li>The Friday the 13th and Halloween franchises aren't that great, but I still respect them</li>
      <li>Slumber Party Massacre was an incredibly cheesy yet fun slasher that deserves more recognition</li>
      <li>Hellraiser was not that great, but Clive Barker and Doug Bradley are amazing. I expected more sceentime for the cenobites and only received 5 minutes of it</li>
    </ul> 
       <h2 style="color:white">Here are the kinds of pets I have had in the past:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li style="color:white">Dog</li>
      <li style="color:white">Duck</li>
      <li style="Color:white">Hamster</li>
      <li style="color:white">Pig</li>
      <li style="color:white">Chicken</li>
      <li style="color:white">Guinea Pig</li>
      <li>Fish</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:white">I wish I could own a crow but it takes so much work. The least I can do is wave at every crow or raven I see :(</p>

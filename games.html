<h1>Rainbow Six Siege</h1>
<h3>Siege would have to be my favorite multiplayer game, even though it's bad. I haven't really played for the last two seasons but I've been playing for a little over a year now</h3>
<h3>My attack main is Zofia and my defense main is Ela. Sometimes I play Twitch, Bandit, Jager, and Valk. No matter what game it is, I play entry frag.. Or anything aggressive</h3>
<h3>All my impressive clips are lost (it actually kinda makes me sad) because I had sent them to people that I no longer talk to. Most of these are funny though. Everything you see is pretty old</h3>
    
<p>This isn't my POV (I'm the Zofia in this clip), but I was rewatching this Mira that I killed and thought it was really funny</p>

<p>Here's a 50 second clip of me panicking about a Monty. I forgot that I still had a teammate alive. I just thought it was really funny because of how much I prefired but never actually shot the Ying (who, well, was right below my bullets)</p>

<p>Here's a ridiculous clip of me messing around with a friend and running shotgun meta (yes that is black ice for the SQCB or whatever it's called)</p>

 <p>Here's are some random flicks and wallbangs</p>
 <p>The first kill in this clip is really bad, I know, but I promise that the second kill 100% makes up for it</p>

<h1>Apex Legends</h1>
    <h3>This is the game that I mainly play nowadays. I really started playing around March or April</h3>
    <h3>I main Wraith and occasionally play Horizon and Wattson. I have to admit that I DC once I'm downed, but at least I'm not a bald Wraith</h3>
    <p>Here's a clip of a really dumb arc star that I stuck</p>

    <p>Here's a clip of an Octane literally being at 1 HP. It was pretty funny to me and I didn't even realize that he died to my tac</p>

<h1>Dead by Daylight</h1>
    <h3>I hate this game. Do not be deceived. I only play it to complete the challenges. I love that there are so many horror characters but I absolutely hate this game.</h3>
    <h3>I only play killer, but I mainly play(ed) Huntress and Nurse</h3>
    <p>This is a clip of a recent match against a Ghostface. It was pretty scary</p>

<h1>Games I Don't (Actively) Play</h1>
<h2>Valorant</h2>
<h3>I hate this game. I absolutely cannot stand it and will never get into it. Same goes with CSGO</h3>
    <p>This is a video of a really undeserved 180 flick</p>

    <h2>Resident Evil</h2>
    <h3>I love everything about Resident Evil. I obviously don't play it actively because they're all singleplayer games. My favorite would definitely have to be RE8 though. I love the Benevientos, and the visuals are amazing</h3>
    <p>Here is a clip of me getting scared by the one and only Mr. X in RE2 (let me tell you this; when I started getting chased by Mr. X, I got so scared that I didn't touch the game for three months). I recommend that you lower your volume</p>

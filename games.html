<h1>Rainbow Six Siege</h1>
<h3>Siege would have to be my favorite multiplayer game, even though it's bad. I haven't really played for the last two seasons but I've been playing for about a year now</h3>
<h3>My attack main is Zofia and my defense main is Ela. Sometimes I play Twitch, Bandit, Jager, and Valk. No matter what game it is, I play entry frag.. Or anything aggressive</h3>
<h3>Sadly all my impressive clips are at home or deleted. Everything you see is pretty old</h3>
    <br>
<p>This isn't my POV (I'm the Zofia in this clip), but I was spectating this Mira that I killed and thought it was really funny

<p>Here's a ridiculous clip of me messing around with a friend and running shotgun meta (yes that is black ice for the SQCB or whatever it's called)</p>

    <h1>Dead by Daylight</h1>
    <h3>I hate this game. Do not be deceived. I only play it to complete the challenges. I love that there are so many horror characters but I absolutely hate this game.</h3>
    <h3>I only play killer, but I mainly play(ed) Huntress and Nurse</h3>
    
<h1>Games I Don't (Actively) Play</h1>
<h2>Valorant</h2>

<h2>Rainbow Six Siege</h2>
<h3>Siege would have to be my favorite multiplayer game, even though it's bad. I haven't really played for the last two seasons but I've been playing for about a year now</h3>
<h3>My attack main is Zofia and my defense main is Ela. Sometimes I play Twitch, Bandit, Jager, and Valk. No matter what game it is, I play entry frag.. Or anything aggressive</h3>
<h3>Sadly all my impressive clips are at home or deleted</h3>
<p>This isn't my POV (I'm the Zofia in this clip), but I was spectating this Mira that I killed and thought it was really funny

<p>Here's a 50 second clip of me panicking about a Monty. I forgot that I still had a teammate alive</p>
